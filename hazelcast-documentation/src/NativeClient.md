## Native Client

Native Client enables you to perform almost all Hazelcast operations without being a member of the cluster. It connects to one of the cluster members and delegates all cluster wide operations to it or connects to all of them and delegate operations smartly. When the relied cluster member dies, client will transparently switch to another live member.

There can be hundreds, even thousands of clients connected to the cluster. But by default there is 40 threads on server side that will handle all the requests. You may want to increase hazelcast.executor.client.thread.count property for better performance.

Imagine a trading application where all the trading data stored and managed in a 10 node Hazelcast cluster. Swing/Web applications at traders' desktops can use Native Java Client to access and modify the data in the Hazelcast cluster.

Currently, Hazelcast has Native Java, C++ and C\# Clients available.

### Java Client

You can perform almost all Hazelcast operations with Java Client. It already implements the same interface. You must include `hazelcast-client.jar` into your classpath.

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Collection;


ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.getGroupConfig().setName("dev").setPassword("dev-pass");
clientConfig.addAddress("10.90.0.1", "10.90.0.2:5702");

HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);
//All cluster operations that you can do with ordinary HazelcastInstance
Map<String, Customer> mapCustomers = client.getMap("customers");
mapCustomers.put("1", new Customer("Joe", "Smith"));
mapCustomers.put("2", new Customer("Ali", "Selam"));
mapCustomers.put("3", new Customer("Avi", "Noyan"));

Collection<Customer> colCustomers = mapCustomers.values();
for (Customer customer : colCustomers) {
     // process customer
}
```
### C++ Client - Enterprise Edition Only

You can use Native C++ Client to connect to Hazelcast nodes and perform almost all operations that a node can perform. Different from nodes, clients do not hold data. It is by default a smart client, i.e. it knows where the data is and asks directly to the correct node. This feature can be disabled (using `ClientConfig::setSmart` method) if you do not want the clients to connect every node.

Features of C++ Clients are:

-	Access to distributed data structures (IMap, IQueue, MultiMap, ITopic, etc.).
-	Access to transactional distributed data structures (TransactionalMap, TransactionalQueue, etc.).
-	Ability to add cluster listeners to a cluster and entry/item listeners to distributed data structures.
-	Distributed synchronization mechanisms with ILock, ISemaphore and ICountDownLatch.

Hazelcast C++ Client is shipped with 32/64 bit, shared and static libraries. Compiled static libraries of dependencies are also available in the release. Dependencies are **zlib** and some of the boost libraries. Below boost libraries are required:

-	`libboost_atomic`
-	`libboost_system`
-	`libboost_chrono`
-	`libboost_thread`
-	`libboost_date_time`

Downloaded release includes the below folders:

-	`docs/ html`, where Doxygen documentation is located.
-	`hazelcast/`
	-	`lib/`, where shared and static library of Hazelcast is located.
	-	`include/`, where client headers are included.
-	`external/`
	-	`lib/`, where compiled static libraries of dependencies is located.
	-	`include/`, where dependency headers are included.

#### Code Examples
A Hazelcast node should be running to make below sample codes work.

##### Map Example

	 #include <hazelcast/client/HazelcastAll.h>
     #include <iostream>

     using namespace hazelcast::client;

     int main(){
         ClientConfig clientConfig;
         Address address("localhost", 5701);
         clientConfig.addAddress(address);

         HazelcastClient hazelcastClient(clientConfig);

         IMap<int,int> myMap = hazelcastClient.getMap<int ,int>("myIntMap");
         myMap.put(1,3);
         boost::shared_ptr<int> v = myMap.get(1);
         if(v.get() != NULL){
             //process the item
         }

         return 0;
     }

##### Queue Example

	 #include <hazelcast/client/HazelcastAll.h>
     #include <iostream>
     #include <string>

     using namespace hazelcast::client;

     int main(){
         ClientConfig clientConfig;
         Address address("localhost", 5701);
         clientConfig.addAddress(address);

         HazelcastClient hazelcastClient(clientConfig);

         IQueue<std::string> q = hazelcastClient.getQueue<std::string>("q");
         q.offer("sample");
         boost::shared_ptr<std::string> v = q.poll();
         if(v.get() != NULL){
             //process the item
         }
         return 0;
     }

##### Entry Listener Example

    #include "hazelcast/client/ClientConfig.h"
    #include "hazelcast/client/EntryEvent.h"
    #include "hazelcast/client/IMap.h"
    #include "hazelcast/client/Address.h"
    #include "hazelcast/client/HazelcastClient.h"
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    using namespace hazelcast::client;

    class SampleEntryListener {
    public:

     void entryAdded(EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event) {
         std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " << event.getValue() << std::endl;
     };

     void entryRemoved(EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event) {
         std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " << event.getValue() << std::endl;
     }

     void entryUpdated(EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event) {
         std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " << event.getValue() << std::endl;
     }

     void entryEvicted(EntryEvent<std::string, std::string> &event) {
         std::cout << "entry added " <<  event.getKey() << " " << event.getValue() << std::endl;
     }
    };


    int main(int argc, char **argv) {

     ClientConfig clientConfig;
     Address address("localhost", 5701);
     clientConfig.addAddress(address);

     HazelcastClient hazelcastClient(clientConfig);

     IMap<std::string,std::string> myMap = hazelcastClient.getMap<std::string ,std::string>("myIntMap");
     SampleEntryListener *  listener = new SampleEntryListener();

     std::string id = myMap.addEntryListener(*listener, true);
     myMap.put("key1", "value1"); //prints entryAdded
     myMap.put("key1", "value2"); //prints updated
     myMap.remove("key1"); //prints entryRemoved
     myMap.put("key2", "value2",1000); //prints entryEvicted after 1 second

     myMap.removeEntryListener(id); //WARNING: deleting listener before removing it from hazelcast leads to crashes.
     delete listener;               //delete listener after remove it from hazelcast.
     return 0;
    };  

##### Serialization Example
Assume that you have the following two classes in Java and you want to use it with C++ client. 

    class Foo implements Serializable{
        private int age;
        private String name;
    }

    class Bar implements Serializable{
        private float x;
        private float y;
    }  

**First**, let them implement `Portable` or `IdentifiedDataSerializable` as shown below.

    class Foo implements Portable {
     private int age;
     private String name;

     public int getFactoryId() {
         return 666;   // a positive id that you choose
     }

     public int getClassId() {
         return 2;     // a positive id that you choose
     }

     public void writePortable(PortableWriter writer) throws IOException {
         writer.writeUTF("n", name);
         writer.writeInt("a", age);
     }

     public void readPortable(PortableReader reader) throws IOException {
         name = reader.readUTF("n");
         age = reader.readInt("a");
     }
    }

    class Bar implements IdentifiedDataSerializable {
     private float x;
     private float y;

     public int getFactoryId() {
         return 4;     // a positive id that you choose
     }

     public int getId() {
         return 5;    // a positive id that you choose
     }

     public void writeData(ObjectDataOutput out) throws IOException {
         out.writeFloat(x);
         out.writeFloat(y);
     }

     public void readData(ObjectDataInput in) throws IOException {
         x = in.readFloat();
         y = in.readFloat();
     }
    } 

**Then**, implement the corresponding classes in C++ with same factory and class ID as shown below:

    class Foo : public Portable {
    public:
     int getFactoryId() const{
         return 666;
     };

     int getClassId() const{
         return 2;
     };

     void writePortable(serialization::PortableWriter &writer) const{
         writer.writeUTF("n", name);
         writer.writeInt("a", age);
     };

     void readPortable(serialization::PortableReader &reader){
         name = reader.readUTF("n");
         age = reader.readInt("a");
     };

    private:
     int age;
     std::string name;
    };

    class Bar : public IdentifiedDataSerializable {
     public:
         int getFactoryId() const{
             return 4;
         };

         int getClassId() const{
             return 2;
         };

         void writeData(serialization::ObjectDataOutput& out) const{
             out.writeFloat(x);
             out.writeFloat(y);
         };

         void readData(serialization::ObjectDataInput& in){
             x = in.readFloat();
             y = in.readFloat();
         };
     private:
         float x;
         float y;
     };

Now, you can use class `Foo` and `Bar` in distributed structures. For example as Key or Value of `IMap` or as an Item in `IQueue`.
